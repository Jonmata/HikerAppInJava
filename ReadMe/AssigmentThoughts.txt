Trail bag
in my program I have my trails saved in a HashSet because we know the maximum amount of trails 
that we can have so that the hashSet can give me fast search and insertion and removel of big O(1)

UserBag
in my User bag it is saved with a tree map to find the user by there user names 
I chosen this structure because we can have unlimited amounts of users with a tree and have a decent search time of logN.

User Class
is your stander user class with the user name,password,phhoneNumber,
LinkedList<Users> for following followers and reviews because we never know how many 
follower and review the user is going to have and we don't need to search though this information to much so thats why we can use a linked list
same reason for the hiking history which is in a LinkedList<History>. 

Admin
extends to user so they can be in the same bag and can use the app like a regular user but had access to two extra tabs in the main view
that allows them to promote a regular user to admin and only the primary admin which is hard coded in to be the primary user can demote a admin but not himself
has only one boolean to tell the differences because normal admins and the primary admin. 

ActiveUser 
just allows me to get the user that login in at any time throughout the program 

BackgroundsForWebsites 
holds the backgrounds for my app and i get them at the initial of the program
to add all my backgrounds to the project 

History
just keeps track of all the trails that the user has walked and how much they walked and when they walked it

Reviews
holds the comment the rating the user name that wrote the comment and when it was writen

Trails
Holds the information about the trail like the address the name of it how hard it is
the trails type and the elevation of the trail

Enum classes 
they just hold the difficulty level and the type of trails there are in the program 
they have a method where they can get a string and then return the equivalent enums from the string given 

Tools package and the Util class
reads the picture that I grabbed from the internet and pasted them in the picture folder the util class reads then and 
puts then in the backgroundforWebsite class for later use and then it checks if there is any data in the BackUpFile
if there is nothing in there then it runs the hard coded dummies trails i coded in other wise it reads the file and restores
the information that was saved when the program closed 

how the search button works 
it first checks if anything is there if the isn't then is sends a message to the user saying to enter something
then is checks if the user input is a number if it is then it gets the number and lower in length and elevation and displays it to the table view
if it is not a number then it checks if its one of the Enum classes if both of then return null then is checks the name and addresses
and gets any strings that contain the character sequence that the user inputed and is plays them
but if the enum classes return and enums then I look through the TrailsBag for the enum classes the matches and display them on the table view
